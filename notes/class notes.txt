*how kubernetes actually works inside?

-Kubernetes works by maintaining the desired state of your application. When we deploy something, the control plane stores our desired configuration in etcd. The scheduler then decides which worker nodes should run the pods. Each node’s kubelet pulls the container image and runs it. Kubernetes continuously monitors the pods—if one fails, it automatically replaces or reschedules it. Networking (via kube-proxy and CNI) lets all pods and services talk to each other reliably. So basically, it automates deployment, scaling, and self-healing of containers across a cluster.
